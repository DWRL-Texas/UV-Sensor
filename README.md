# UV Sensor with LCD
This tutorial explains how to create a UV sensor plus readout using an Arduino Uno and an LCD1602 + I2C Backpack

## Parts:
- UV (GUVA S12 SD) sensor
- LCD1602 + I2C Backpack
- Arduino + USB Cable
- Jumper wires

## Download and Install:
- Download and unzip the **UV-Sensor zip** file by clicking the green *Clone or Download* button above and selecting *Download ZIP*
- Unzip this file; all the files you'll need will be contained inside
- Unzip the **LiquidCrystal_I2C.zip** file, and drag the subsequent **LiquidCrystal_I2C-1.1.2 FOLDER** to the Documents/Arduino/libraries folder. 
- This will install the necessary library in the Arduino IDE

## Set up Arduino Circuit:
- Open the **UV-Sensor-bb.pdf** file and follow the visual pinout instructions to set up your circuit

## IDE Code:
- Double click the **UV_sensor_model.ino** file from your download and say Yes to the Arduino IDE pop-up window.
- The file should open directly in your Arduino IDE application
- Click the Compile button to be sure the code has no bugs, then plug in your Arduino circuit and Upload the code
